    <p class="text-highlight">Hi I'm Erik, glad you're here! I'm an Offensive Security Consultant and Penetration Tester of 5 years with a passion for breaking systems to understand how they work and helping secure them in the process. With experience in real-world penetration testing, Application Security, API, and secure code review, I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities manually that others miss by approaching testing with both logic and strong intuition. I present findings clearly and effectively. I hold the OSCP certification and have contributed to a broad variety of engagements.<br><br>Beyond security, I enjoy building my Discord.py bot and learning programming languages from a software development perspective. My goal is always the same, to understand systems deeply, challenge assumptions, and deliver impactful results. I'm currently working towards the OSWE certification and I'll be looking into an Active Directory certification following that. On this site you'll find what I've been working on lately, a sample penetration test report, my socials and resume, and a link to my blog. </p>
